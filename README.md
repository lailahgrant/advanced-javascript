### Nested function's scope
> Scope
> * Block scope - variables declared inside a pair of curly braces cannot be accessed from outside  the block.
> - Function scope - variables declared inside a function cannot be accessed from outside the function.
> *  Global scope - globally scoped variables can be accessed inside a block or function.
